# Hi! I'm Zane.

I'm a recent graduate of Western Governors University (Dec '23) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have acquired certifications in CompTIA Project+ and ITIL Foundations. I'm looking forward to starting my career in software development.

As a curious person who enjoys learning new things and problem-solving, I am so excited to improve my skills and grow in my new career. I am currently looking for a full time position and am open to entry level roles. I have experience with Python, Django, Java, C, HTML, C++, MySQL, and VBA. I'm ready and willing to learn new languages and frameworks.

I have many hobbies, including role-playing games, creative writing, and art. My creativity is one of my best features!

Please feel free to contact me to discuss relevant opportunities. I can't wait to hear from you!
